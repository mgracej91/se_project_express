# WTWR (What to Wear?)

This back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR (What to wear) application. I used Express.js to simplify and streamline the process of building my web application and APIs with Node.js.

## Tech stack:

- Node.js
  JavaScript runtime environment
- Express.js
  Web framework
- JSON
  Data format
- Mongoose
  MongoDB object modeling library
- MongoDB
  Data base for Mongoose
- Postman
  API testing tool

  ## Key Features:

- Dynamic Routes are used for handling the URLS to a certain rule as shown in one of the routes files below.

One of the challenges I had in doing this project was handling errors. Error handling is a key feature to make this web application user friendly. Having the correct error codes align with the appropriate error message was a tedious and tricky part of this project. Using the Postman tool was very helpful in debugging the errors and making the appropriate corrections so that the APIs ran sufficiently.
